              Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) observes particles of solar, interplanetary, interstellar, and galactic origins, spanning the energy range from solar wind ions to galactic cosmic ray nuclei.To know more visit <a href= "https://science.nasa.gov/missions/ace/"> Advanced Composition Explorer </a>

              An Analog is a situation on Earth that produces effects on the body similar to those experienced in space, both physical and mental/emotional. These studies help prepare us for long duration missions. NASA is associated with at least 15 analog missions throughout the world. to know more visit <a href= "http://www.nasa.gov/analogs">Analog Missions</a>

            <p>Balloon Array for Radiation-belt Relativistic Electron Losses (BARREL) is a balloon-based Mission of Opportunity to augment the measurements of NASA's Van Allen Probes spacecraft. BARREL seeks to measure the precipitation of relativistic electrons from the radiation belts during two multi-balloon campaigns, operated in the southern hemispheres to have the brief knowledge <a href= "https://www.nasa.gov/mission-pages/rbsp/barrel"> barrel mission</a> </p>

            <p>With its rover named Curiosity, Mars Science Laboratory mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, a long-term effort of robotic exploration of the red planet. Curiosity was designed to assess whether Mars ever had an environment able to support small life forms called microbes. In other words, its mission is to determine the planet's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/overview/index.html"> "habitability"﻿</a>

              <img src ="./img/FAST.jpg" width="250" height ="200">
              <p>FAST, the Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer, was the second Small Explorer mission. FAST investigated the behavior of ionized gas, called plasma, and particles during auroras. Auroras generally form when solar material causes a disturbance in near-Earth space, either in the form of a cloud called a coronal mass ejection or a variation in the sun’s constant outflow of material known as the solar wind. </p>

              <p> Edwin Hubble, for whom the Hubble Telescope is named, used the largest telescope of his day in the 1920s at the Mt. Wilson Observatory near Pasadena, Calif., to discover galaxies beyond our own.Hubble's launch and deployment in April 1990 marked the most significant advance in astronomy since Galileo's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/story/index.html">telescope</a>

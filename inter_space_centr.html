          <form class="quote">
            <p> 
              &rsaquo; &nbsp; The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. 
              Its first component launched into orbit in 1998, 
              the last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and the station is expected to be used until 2028.<br>
              
              &rsaquo; &nbsp; Zarya, the first ISS module, was launched by a Proton rocket on 20 November 1998.
              The STS-88 shuttle mission followed two weeks after Zarya was launched, bringing Unity, 
              the first of three node modules, and connecting it to Zarya.<br>
              
              &rsaquo; &nbsp; This means that the owners of the Space Station - the United States, Russia, the European Partner, Japan and Canada -
              are legally responsible for the respective elements they provide.
              The European States are being treated as one homogenous entity, called the European Partner on the Space Station.<br>
              
              &rsaquo; &nbsp; Every so often, you can see the ISS in your night sky. To us on Earth, it looks like a bright star moving quickly above the horizon.
              Then, just as suddenly as it appears, it disappears. ...
              Visible to the naked eye, the station is best seen at dawn and dusk, and is the third brightest object in the sky.

            <h4 id="aside-block"> Notable Milestones</h4>
            <p>
              The ISS has had several notable milestones over the years, when it comes to crews:<br>
            </p>
            <p style="font-style:italic;">  &rsaquo; &nbsp;   Most consecutive days in space by an American: 340 days, which happened when Scott Kelly took part in a one-year mission to 
              &nbsp;the International Space Station in 2015-16 (along with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko). 
              &nbsp;The space agencies did a comprehensive suite of experiments on the astronauts, including a "twin study" with Kelly and
              &nbsp;his Earth-bound former astronaut twin,Mark. 
              &nbsp;NASA has expressed interest in more long-duration missions, although none have yet been announced.</i><br>
              
              &rsaquo; &nbsp;   Longest single spaceflight by a woman: 289 days, during American astronaut Peggy Whitson's 2016-17 mission aboard the space station.<br>
              &rsaquo;&nbsp;    Most total time spent in space by a woman: Again, that's Peggy Whitson, who racked up most of her 665 days in space on the ISS.<br>
              
              &rsaquo;&nbsp;    Biggest space gathering: 13 people, during NASA's STS-127 shuttle mission aboard Endeavour in 2009. 
              &nbsp;(It's been tied a few times during later missions.)<br>
              &rsaquo;&nbsp;    Longest single spacewalk: 8 hours and 56 minutes during STS-102, for an ISS construction mission in 2001.
              &nbsp;NASA astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms participated.<br>
              &rsaquo;&nbsp;    Longest Russian spacewalk: 8 hours and 13 minutes during Expedition 54, to repair an ISS antenna. 
              &nbsp;Russian astronauts Alexander Misurkin and Anton Shkaplerov participated.<br>

            <img src="./img/Satellite.jpg" align="right" width="50%">
            <p align="left">The International Space Station (ISS) offers a unique platform for access to low-Earth orbit (LEO)through its Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) airlock working in coordination with the JEM robotic arm.This small airlock allows small devices such as CubeSats to be deployed into LEO while making the trip up to space in the relative comfort of a pressurized cargo container.This can have many benefits in reducing the cost to small satellite operators specifically in the number of launch testing and redundancy requirements for the developer. Lower cost leads to more financial incentive to enable small operators
              to design and prove out their technology in space.</p>

              <h3> Robotics </h3>
              <img src="./img/Robotics_tech.jpg" align="right" width="50%">
              <p align="left">Key to enhancing human spaceflight missions is the ability of robots to work alongside the human crew to perform necessary tasks more efficiently. These tasks include those that are monotonous or risky and impose on the available time astronauts have to focus on science experiments. The International Space Station provides an excellent platform where these operational concepts and procedures can be developed, tested and evolved in an actual space environment while demonstrating robotic systems performance and reliability over the long duration. The precision and reliability requirements for space robotics led to dual-purpose technologies and advanced robotic capabilities for use on Earth.</p>

              <img src="./img/Transportation.jpg" align="right" width="50%">
              <p align="left">Combustion science is one of the longest running fields of research on the International Space Station (ISS). There is a long running campaign to understand just how both simple and more complex fuels burn in space. Understanding this process in microgravity helps us refine combustion models on Earth where gravity and turbulent buoyancy-driven convection flows make this process too difficult to model. Recent observations on ISS have shown that a phenomenon known as “cool flames” can be witnessed in the combustion chambers in orbit to understand how lower temperature burning could have significant applications towards more efficient fuel use and new combustion engine designs in the future.</p>

            <form class="quote">
              <p>In space, physical processes can be better understood with the control of external influences such as gravity. Technical innovations designed for space systems are tested on the International Space Station (ISS) before use in other spacecraft systems. While investigating how new technologies operate in space, unexpected discoveries are possible. Simplified physical systems can also be directly used to improve models of physical processes leading to new industrial techniques and materials. </p>

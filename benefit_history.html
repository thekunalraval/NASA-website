            <h3>Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs)</h3>
            <p>Red light-emitting diodes are growing plants in space and healing humans on Earth. The LED technology used in NASA space shuttle plant growth experiments has contributed to the development of medical devices such as award-winning WARP 10, a hand-held, high-intensity, LED unit developed by Quantum Devices Inc. .</p>

            <h3>Infrared Ear Thermometers </h3>
            <p>Diatek Corporation and NASA developed an aural thermometer, which weighs only 8 ounces and uses infrared astronomy technology to measure the amount of energy emitted by the eardrum, the same way the temperature of stars and planets is measured.</p>

            <h3>Anti-Icing Systems</h3>
            <p>NASA funding under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and work with NASA scientists advanced the development of the certification and integration of a thermoelectric deicing system called Thermawing, a DC-powered air conditioner for single-engine aircraft called Thermacool, and high-output alternators to run them both. </p>

            <h3>Pollution Remediation</h3>
            <p>A product using NASA’s microencapsulating technology is available to consumers and industry enabling them to safely and permanently clean petroleum-based pollutants from water. The microencapsulated wonder, Petroleum Remediation Product or “PRP,” has revolutionized the way oil spills are cleaned. The basic technology behind PRP is thousands of microcapsules—tiny balls of beeswax with hollow centers. Water cannot penetrate the microcapsule’s cell, but oil is absorbed right into the beeswax spheres as they float on the water’s surface. Contaminating chemical compounds that originally come from crude oil (such as fuels, motor oils, or petroleum hydrocarbons) are caught before they settle, limiting damage to ocean beds.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <form class="quote">
            <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), is responsible for unique scientific and technological achievements in human space flight, 
              aeronautics, space science, and space applications that have had widespread impacts on our nation and the world. Forged in response to early Soviet
              space achievements, NASA was built on the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and other government organizations, as the locus of U. S. 
              civil aerospace research and development.  When NASA opened for business on October 1, 1958, it accelerated
              the work already started on human and robotic space flight. NASA's first high profile program was Project Mercury,
              an effort to learn if humans could survive in space.
              From 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X-1.[17] In the early 1950s,
              there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet
              launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The US Congress,
              alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the "Sputnik crisis"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D.
              Eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a "Special Committee on Space Technology", headed by Guyford Stever.
              On January 14, 1958, NACA Director Hugh Dryden published "A National Research Program for Space Technology" stating						</p>
